# Markdown Previewer

This is a project I did as part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Library Course. 

The primary goal was to use React or any other front end libraries to create a Markdown Previewer tool, that will display anything entered into the editor box as Markdown Text in the preview box below it.

I primarily used React.js, Redux and CSS.

I also used Marked.js Library to parse the text.
