# Markdown Previewer

This is a project I did as part of FreeCodeCamp's Front End Library Course. 

I built this on codepen.io, the original project can be viewed [here](https://codepen.io/tory24/full/ExyqGpg)

### Aim

The primary aim was to use React or any other front end libraries I have learnt to create a Markdown Previewer tool, that will immediately display anything entered into the editor box as Markdown Text in the preview box below it.


#### Languages Used

I primarily used React.js and CSS.

I also used [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) Library to parse the text.
